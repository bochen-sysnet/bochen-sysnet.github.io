This is Bo Chen, a postdoc at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) working with Prof. Klara Nahrstedt. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science at UIUC in 2022, advised by Prof. Klara Nahrstedt. Before coming to UIUC, I got my B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), under the supervision of Prof. Xinbing Wang.

Immersive computing integrates AR, VR, and system techniques to create seamless, interactive digital environments. However, existing immersive system suffer from a loose coupling problem where processing modules are local optimal and data is discrete, leading to inefficiency and artifacts. To overcome these obstacles, my research advocates AI-system co-design to advance immersive computing, an approach with two core principles:

1. **AI-for-Immersion Insight**: *Identifying insights from Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to overcome the limitation of traditional immersive computing systems*.
2. **AI-System Joint Design**: *Customized system optimization and adapt AI architecture or training to overcome performance degradation of AI systems*.

Guided by these principles, my research bridges the gap between current immersive computing systems and the Metaverse, advancing:
1. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: [NSDI'24](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi24-chen-bo.pdf), [SenSys'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3666025.3699324)
2. **Photo-realism**: [MobiCom'25](https://www.sigmobile.org/mobicom/2025/cfp.html), [MobiSys'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3643832.3661879), 
3. **Reliability**: [MMSys'24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3625468.3647621), [MIPR'24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707806), [ICML'23 NCW](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17236)

**Research Interests: Networking, operating systems, virtual reality, immersive/visual/spatial computing, and mobile computing.**

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">I am now actively looking for tenure-track faculty positions (2024-2025). Feel free to ping me if you have any openings.</span>
